Module 1:

A Zero Trust network security model is based on which security principle?
 least priviledge


Security Operating Platform
 • prevents all known threats, fast
 • reduces the attack surface
 • provides full visibility
 • detects and prevents new unknown threats with automation
it does not: maintain persistent connectivity for end-users.


What is the defintion of Ubiquity?
 • Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, and the services can be used anywhere.


Malicious software that damages, takes control of, or collects information at an infected endpoint is also known as
 • malware - malware broadly includes: viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, anti-av, logic bombs, backdoors, rootkits, bootkits, spyware and adware.


Applications are designed to circumvent traditional port based firewalls using these techniques:
 • port hopping
 • use of non-standard ports
 • tunneling within commonly used services
 • hiding within SSL encryption
they do not, however, command and control via virtual machine services.


Most cyberattacks today are NOT perpetuated by internal threat actors, such as malicious employees, engaging in corporate espionage.

Next generation firewall security policies provide persistent security for each of the following:
 • users
 • content
 • applications
they do not provide security for acceptable use policies.


The PCI DSS is mandated and administered by the
 • PCI Security Standards Council - SSC


Perimeter based firewalls identify threats associated with 
 • north - south traffic
they do not identify threats with east - west traffic.


DevOps in which developers or IT operations teams can provision and manage the infrastructure stack such as VM's, networks, and connectivity for an app in software is:
 • IaC


A firewall DMZ zone is not typically protected by one firewall placed between the DMZ and the internal network. 

Someone with limited hacking or programming skills that uses malicious malware to attack a computer is not known as a newbie.

The cloud computing service model which a provider's applications run on a cloud infrastruucture and the consumer does not manage or control the infrastructure is known as
 • SaaS - software as a service
it is not IaaS, PaaS, or IDaaS


The Cyber Attack Lifecycle is not a five-step processs.

The increase in WFA and WFH presents challenges for security services to identify and protect additional threat vectors.

The Security Operating Platform consists of a tightly integrated system of components and services, including a partner ecosystem that delivers consistent security across tthe network, endpoints, and cloud.
 • true

The Security Operating Platform prevents successful attacks and stops attacks in progress while providing consistent protection to secure the enterprise, the cloud, and the future.
 • true

The Security Operating platform proactively blocks known threats, which provides baseline defenses against known exploits, malware, malicious URLs, and C2 activity
 • true


The primary issue with a perimeter based network security is that it relies on assumptions that everything on the internal network can be trusted.
 • true


The principle of least privilege in network security does NOT require that only permissions or access rights necessary to perform an authorized task is denied.


A vulnerability is NOT a small piece of software code, or a sequence of string commands to cause unintended behavior in a system or software.

Most Botnets are NOT designed to withstand the loss of a command and control C2 server, meaning that the entire Botnet infrastructure does not have to be disabled simultaneously.


An effective security strategy is to deploy Perimeter-Based Network defense, where couuntermeasures are defined,
but you cannot assume everything on the internal network can be trusted.


Trust Management typically has rules that describe all of the following:
 • credentials
 • policies
 • actions
 • principles
it does not describe Hierarchial Roles


An easy way to make your WiFI security stronger and more difficult to be discovered is to
 • change the Service Set Identifier - SSID


An attack that is intended to cause rapid damage to the victim's network and system infrastructure, 
as well as their business and reputation is known as;
 • distributed denial of service - DDoS attack


Which type of malware allows an attacker to bypass authentication to gain access to a system?
 • Backdoor


Which type of malware is triggered by a specific condition, specific date or a particular user account being disabled?
 • Logic Bomb


Which type of malware targets a computer network by replicating itself to spread rapidly?
 • Worm


Which capability of a Zero-Trust segmentation platform uses a combination of anti-malware, instrusion prevention, and cyberthreat prevention technologies?
 • Cyberthreat protection
it is not:
 • inspection of all traffic
 • least privilege access control 
 • secure access


Which cybersecurity act defines individual rights with respect to the privacy of their personal information and governs how private sector organizations collect personal information in the course of business?
 • Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - PIPEDA


Which cybersecurity regulation strengths data protection for European Union residents and export of personal data outside of the EU?
 • General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR


Zero Trust design principles are the following:
 • inspect and log all traffic
 • adopt a least privilege strategy and strictly enforce access control
 • ensure that all resources are accessd securely, regardless of location
it is not
 • allow internal users to access network services through remote access


Zeru-Trust networks benefit from the following:
 • improved ability to securely enable transformative IT initiatves
 • greater efficiency for achieving and maintaing compliance with security and privacy mandates
 • clearly improve effectiveness in mitigating data loss with visibility and enablement of applications
it does not benefit from
 • higher total cost of ownership TCO with a consolidated and fully integrated security operating platform


Endpoints are all:
 • point of sale terminal - POS
 • desktop
 • smartphone
but not a mainframe


Important characteristics and capabilities of advanced malware are:
 • hiding techniques such as poloymorphism and metamorphism
 • hiding techniques such as obfuscation
 • multi-functionality
 • distributed, fault tolerant architecture
a none important characteristic is matching AV virus signatures


The secure the cloud technology that functions as a multimode to minimize range of cloud risks is:
 • Prisma SaaS
it is not, prisma access, prisma sase, or prisma cloud


Which secure the enterprise network security technology enables centralized control from a single pane of glass?
 • Panorama
it is not, subscription services, next gen firewall, or vm series firewall


Which secure the future technology serves security teams across the incident lifecycle?
 • Cortex XSOAR
it is not cortex XDR, cortex data lake, or autofocus


Which security operating platform allows organizations to exert positive control based on apps, users, etc, and visiblity?
 • reduce the attack surface
it is not, prevent all known threats fast, provide full visibility, or detect and prevent new unknown threats


Which security operating platform supports coordinated security platforms for full scope of attack across various security controls?
 • prevent all known threats, fast


Which technique is used to break the command and control - CnC phase of the cyber kill chain?
 • vulnerability and patch management
is it not DNS sinkholing, blocking outbound traffic, or DNS poisoning


Which types of attackers are motivated by political or social causes?
 • hacktivists


Which type of Wildfire analysis methods are used to determine real world effects and behaviour?
 • dynamnic
it is not machine, bare metal, or static


Which Wildfire verdict indicates no security risk but might display obtrusive behavior?
 • grayware
is it not benign, phishing, or malware
