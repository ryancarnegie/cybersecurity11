Module 1:

A Zero Trust network security model is based on which security principle?

Security Operating Platform
 • prevents all known threats, fast
 • reduces the attack surface
 • provides full visibility
 • detects and prevents new unknown threats with automation
it does not: maintain persistent connectivity for end-users.


What is the defintion of Ubiquity?
 • Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, and the services can be used anywhere.


Malicious software that damages, takes control of, or collects information at an infected endpoint is also known as
 • malware - malware broadly includes: viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, anti-av, logic bombs, backdoors, rootkits, bootkits, spyware and adware.


Applications are designed to circumvent traditional port based firewalls using these techniques:
 • port hopping
 • use of non-standard ports
 • tunneling within commonly used services
 • hiding within SSL encryption
they do not, however, command and control via virtual machine services.


Most cyberattacks today are NOT perpetuated by internal threat actors, such as malicious employees, engaging in corporate espionage.

Next generation firewall security policies provide persistent security for each of the following:
 • users
 • content
 • applications
they do not provide security for acceptable use policies.


The PCI DSS is mandated and administered by the
 • PCI Security Standards Council - SSC


Perimeter based firewalls identify threats associated with 
 • north - south traffic
they do not identify threats with east - west traffic.


DevOps in which developers or IT operations teams can provision and manage the infrastructure stack such as VM's, networks, and connectivity for an app in software is:
 • IaC
